# WeblyWeddings
A social networking site developed in 24-hours using Java EE technologies for a hackathon conducted by Ascendant Technologies. The project follows Model View Controler(MVC) design pattern.  

**WEBLYWEDDINGS IS NOT A MATRIMONIAL WEBSITE :P**

WeblyWeddings is a way of inviting guests to wedding functions online. A wedding function will have several events, photos etc. Bride or Bridegroom creates a wedding in WeblyWeddings and provides the Wedding ID to the guests through the invitation. Guests can login to WeblyWedings and know more information about the wedding. They can view, like the photos and even make a comment.
